                        <br>
                        <strong>What information do we collect?</strong>We collect information so that we can provide the best possible experience when you utilize our Services.Much of what you likely consider personal data is collected directly from you when you:<br>

                        These methods of collection may not be as obvious to you,so we wanted to highlight and explain below a bit more about what these might be(as they vary from time to time) and how they work:<br>
